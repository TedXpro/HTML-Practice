            On systems with multiple command interpreters to choose from, the
            interpreters are known as shells. For example, on UNIX and Linux systems, a
            user may choose among several different shells, including the Bourne shell, C
            shell, Bourne-Again shell, Korn shell, and others. Third-party shells and free
            user-written shells are also available.
