        <p>In reality, I rarely use absolute positioning for page layout. It’s just too dif-
            ficult to get working and too inflexible for the range of modern browsers.
            However, it is still used in certain specialty situations like web game devel-
            opment where the programmer is deliberately subverting normal layout
            schemes for more control of the visual interface.</p>

        <p>Page layout has been a constant concern in web development. There have
            been many different approaches to page layout, and all have weaknesses.
            The current standard is the floating mechanism. While this works quite well,
            it has two major weaknesses</p>

        <p>It’s a lot more detail-oriented: Absolute positioning is a commitment.
            You often end up having to directly control the size and position of
            every element on the screen, which is tedious and difficult.
            ✦ It’s not as flexible: With responsive design (creating a page that can
            adapt to the many different devices available) all the rage today, the
            absolute position scheme simply doesn’t deliver the flexibility needed in
            modern web development</p>

        <p>CSS3 proposes a new layout mechanism which aims to solve a lot of the
            layout problems that have plagued web development. The flexible box
            layout scheme (sometimes called flexbox) shows a lot of promise. Here’s
            essentially how it works (I’m deliberately leaving out details here for clarity.
            Read on for specific implementation)</p>
