      <h1>AAU CS Department</h1>
      <p>Modern higher education in Ethiopia began with the founding of the University College of Addis Ababa on March
        20, 1950.
        When formal lectures started in the College on December 11, 1950, the Faculty of Science, one of the only two
        Faculties
        then, had only two departments or sections, known as Section A and Section B. In Section A, students were given
        basic
        training in Engineering, which would enable them to go abroad to specialize in one of the many branches of
        Engineering,
        whereas those in Section B were prepared for Medical School as well as for further studies in Biology and allied
        fields.

        In 1956-57 the Faculty took a step forward by changing the three-year Section B program into a four-year B.Sc.
        degree
        program in Biology. By 1959-60, there were three B.Sc. degree offering programs in the following combination of
        subjects: Course A -Mathematics and Physics; Course B -Biology and Chemistry; and Course C -Chemistry and
        Geology.
        Similarly, in 1959-60, the Section A program was amalgamated with the newly established Engineering College.

        When the Haile Selassie I University was established in 1961, the Faculty of Science was reorganized into five
        teaching
        Departments, all offering B.Sc. degree programs. These were the Departments of: Biology, Chemistry, Geology,
        Mathematics, and Physics. A Forestry Department, the Natural History Museum and the National Herbarium were
        established
        a little later, while a Statistical Training Centre was opened in the Department of Mathematics, center that
        developed
        into a full-fledged Department of Statistics in the early 1970s.</p>
